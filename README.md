## Notes

A challenge I enccountered while building the app was how to maintain a history of previouis cards so that the previous card button works as intended. Design wise, I had to make sure the card size was consistent no matter how much text was presented. At first, clicking through the cards resulted in different card sizes because the size depended on the amount of text being displayed.
